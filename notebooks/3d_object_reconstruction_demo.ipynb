    "## Step 1: Data Preparation and Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook comes with a sample dataset and a base configuration file that allows users to optimize their results. This section covers suitable object types and dataset capturing instructions. While the sample dataset includes April tags, these are not utilized in our current pipeline and do not impact the quality of reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Object Types\n",
    "\n",
    "For optimal reconstruction results, choose objects with the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rigid, Non-Deformable Objects**: The workflow performs best with objects that maintain a fixed shape across frames\n",
    "- **Rich Surface Texture**: High texture variance enables reliable feature detection and matching, which is critical for accurate reconstruction\n",
    "- **Asymmetrical Objects**: Distinct content on different faces helps avoid ambiguity during feature matching\n",
    "- **Opaque Materials**: Avoid transparent or translucent materials (glass, clear plastic) as they interfere with depth and feature consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Capturing Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve optimal 3D reconstruction quality, follow these steps when capturing object images. The goal is to ensure complete coverage of the object's geometry while maintaining consistency in framing and orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Position the Object\n",
    "- **Centering**: Place the object in the center of the camera frame\n",
    "- **Size**: The object should occupy roughly 45-65% of the image area - large enough to capture details while providing context\n",
    "- **Lighting**: \n",
    "  - Use even, diffused lighting to minimize harsh shadows and reflections\n",
    "  - Avoid backlighting or direct overhead lights that create glare or overexposure\n",
    "  - Ensure the object is well-lit from multiple directions to reveal surface details\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Capture the First Set (Primary Faces)\n",
    "- Begin image capture while slowly rotating the object horizontally in one direction (clockwise or counterclockwise)\n",
    "- Cover approximately 360 degrees of rotation\n",
    "- This step should expose four visible faces of the object: front, back, and both sides\n",
    "- Capture multiple overlapping frames to ensure robust feature matching across angles\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Capture the Second Set (Remaining Faces)\n",
    "- Flip the object to reveal previously hidden faces (typically top and bottom)\n",
    "- Continue capturing images while rotating slightly, following the same pattern as the previous step\n",
    "- Ensure full coverage of the remaining two faces with overlapping views for consistent alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "The animation below demonstrates the full object rotation and flip process, showing how to cover all six faces in a consistent, controlled manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"../data/docs/adv.gif\" alt=\"Capture Example\" title=\"Capture Example\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manual Capture Guidelines (Alternative Method)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a turntable is not available, you can capture the data manually by following these guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Scan-like Movement\n",
    "- Hold the object in your hands and rotate it manually in front of the camera\n",
    "- Treat the process like scanning the object: gradually expose all surfaces to the camera\n",
    "- Rotate the object slowly and smoothly, ensuring sufficient visual overlap between consecutive frames\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Maximize Visible Surface Area\n",
    "- Ensure the camera can see a large portion of the object's surface in each frame\n",
    "- Avoid fast or jerky movements - slower rotations help the system track features accurately\n",
    "- Verify that all six faces of the object (front, back, sides, top, and bottom) are captured clearly\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Maintain Consistent Distance\n",
    "- Keep the object at a consistent distance from the camera throughout the capture process\n",
    "- Avoid moving the object significantly closer or farther during capture\n",
    "\n",
    "The animation below demonstrates effective manual object capture technique.\n",
    "\n",
